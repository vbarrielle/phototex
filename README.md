# phototex, a generator for latex photo albums

If you need a simple photo album as a pdf that you can print, then phototex
may be the right tool for you.

## Usage

```
$ mkdir photo_album
$ cd photo_album
$ phototex ../images
$ make
```

Then send your pdf to a printer.

## Status

This is still a work in progress, nothing really works for now.
