# Example of phototex usage

In the folder `source_images`, a selection of images we want to put in an
album are placed. There are two subfolders, one for each place we went.

Running

```
$ phototex  source_images -o latex_album --title "Beautiful Places" --title-image-name 2016-08-09_12-39-40.jpg
```

will produce a photo album in `tex_album/photobook.pdf`. The first run will
take some time, as the images will be downscaled to be at the minimum resolution
to maintain a correct dpi.

By default, this album will use the A4 format in portrait mode.
The layout of the album in this format is composed as follows:

- landscape images are grouped to have two per page
- portrait images are grouped to have four per page
- the rest of the images will be grouped with either two portrait images
  and one landscape, or two portraits, or one single portrait per page.
- it is possible to choose explicitly which portrait image should be put alone
  on its page, using a `specs.json` file in the appropriate subfolder.

The `specs.json` file can also be used to give a title to each subfolder. Here's
an example of a valid `specs.json` file:

```json
{
  "title": "Chambord's castle",
  "one_portraits": ["2016-11-11_12-45-00.jpg"]
}
```

The `one_portraits` entry can be omitted, as in:

```json
{
  "title": "Rathlin Island",
}
```

The latex code generated by phototex is stored in `latex_album`. It is possible
to modify it to meet your specific needs. However, if phototex runs again, any
modification will be lost.
